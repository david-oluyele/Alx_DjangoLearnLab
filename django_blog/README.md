# Django Blog - Comment System
This README section describes the implementation of the comment functionality added to the blog project. The comment system allows users to post comments on blog posts, and authenticated users can edit or delete their own comments.

## Features
Add Comments: Authenticated users can post comments on blog posts.
Edit Comments: Users can edit their own comments.
Delete Comments: Users can delete their own comments.
View Comments: All users can view comments associated with a specific blog post.
How It Works
The comment system is integrated into the blog post detail page, allowing users to:

See a list of all comments under each blog post.
Post new comments if they are authenticated.
Edit or delete their own comments if they are the author.
Comment Model
The Comment model stores information related to each comment:

post: The blog post the comment is associated with (foreign key to the Post model).
author: The user who wrote the comment (foreign key to Djangoâ€™s built-in User model).
content: The text of the comment.
created_at: Timestamp when the comment was created.
updated_at: Timestamp when the comment was last updated.
Comment Views
CommentCreateView: Allows authenticated users to create a comment for a post.
CommentUpdateView: Allows users to edit their own comments.
CommentDeleteView: Allows users to delete their own comments.
Comment Forms
The CommentForm is used to create and update comments. It is a Django ModelForm for the Comment model, which includes the content of the comment.

# URL Patterns
The comment-related actions are mapped to the following URL patterns:

Create a comment: /posts/<int:post_id>/comments/new/
Edit a comment: /posts/<int:post_id>/comments/<int:pk>/edit/
Delete a comment: /posts/<int:post_id>/comments/<int:pk>/delete/
Permissions
Only authenticated users can add, edit, or delete comments.
Users can only edit or delete comments they have authored.
All users can view comments on blog posts.
