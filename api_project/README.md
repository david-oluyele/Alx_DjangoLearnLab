# API Project - Authentication and Permissions with Django REST Framework

## Overview

This project implements **authentication** and **permissions** using Django REST Framework (DRF) to secure API endpoints. By integrating token-based authentication and permission classes, we ensure that only authorized users can access or modify data.

## Features

- **Token Authentication**:
  - Users can authenticate using tokens generated by DRF's `Token` model.
  - Tokens are required for accessing restricted API endpoints.
  
- **Permission Handling**:
  - API views enforce permissions to restrict access based on user roles or authentication status.
  - Uses DRF's built-in permissions like `IsAuthenticated` and `IsAdminUser`.

- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Fully implemented CRUD operations for managing books.
